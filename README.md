# Announcement of deprecation

This extension is now deprecated. **Github Copilot Chat** already has a much better method of automatically generating
entire workspaces with the click of a button. There are a number of benefits to using that instead of GPT automate, so
I highly reccomend you use that instead.

Thank you to all beta testers who gave feedback, helped me improve the extension and used the extension for free.
I learned a lot in this process (and got an A+ for my final project) thanks to you all.

The backend API for gpt automate has been shutdown.
