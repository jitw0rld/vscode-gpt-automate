## Features 🔥

### Capabilities 🚀

-   ✅ Make files with code in them
-   ✅ Create a project structure
-   ✅ Run commands, files and programs automatically
-   ✅ Create a workspace
-   ✅ Works in any language (But you **MUST** be specific!)
-   ✅ Can see the file names of all files in your workspace (excluding node_modules because it is too large)

### Limitation ⚠️

-   ❌ It can not view code in any of your files
-   ❌ It can only write so much text in files in one prompt
-   ❌ It has a tendency to reject prompts, even if they are good. Try to word it a little differently and be more verbose.
-   ❌ It can not work with files outside of the workspace
-   ❌ It has a tendency to reject prompts not JavaScript or C related due to the pre-prompt included in the code. This just means be more verbose and it will likely work.
-   ❌ Prompt max length can be reached if you have a very large workspace. This is being fixed.

## Installation 📦

### Visual Studio Code

2. Click Install
3. Navigate to settings, and under **Extensions > GPT Automate** (or search `vscode-gpt-automate`), set your API key.
4. Reload VSCode if necessary

### Neovim

1. Install pynvim: `pip install pynvim`
2. Create a folder inside `~/.config/nvim/plugged` called `gpt-automate-nvim` (On windows, it's `~\AppData\Local\nvim-data\plugged`)
3. Import `nvim-plugin/gpt-automate.py` into `~/.config/nvim/plugged/gpt-automate-nvim`

4. Enter this line between `plug#begin()` and `plug#end()` in your `init.vim` file:

```vim
Plug 'Plug '~/gpt-automate-nvim'
```

5. Set your API key in init.vim

```vim
let g:vscode_gpt_automate_api_key = "<your_api_key_here>"
```

6. Run `:source $MYVIMRC` to reload your `init.vim` file
7. Run `:PlugInstall` to install the plugin

## How to Use 📝

### Visual Studio Code

1. Open a workspace
2. Press `CTRL+SHIFT+P`
3. Type "`GPT`"
4. Select `GPT Automate Prompt`
5. Type your prompt
6. Press Enter

### Neovim

1. Open a workspace
2. Type `:GPTAutomatePrompt`
3. Type your prompt
4. Press Enter

While it _may_ be able to deliver on bad prompts, it's **generally recommended** to stick with good prompt conventions to get more reliable results.

## How to write Good Prompts

-   ✅ Be Specific
-   ✅ Tell it what files to make
-   ✅ Tell it if you want to run it afterwards or not
-   ✅ Tell it what language(s) to use

### Good Prompts:

-   ✅ Make a nodejs program in JavaScript that says babbur 1,000 times and run it
-   ✅ Make a website in HTML with a few buttons on it that when clicked alert babbur
-   ✅ Make a file called main.py, write a program in Python that says babbur 1,000 times, and run it
-   ✅ Make a file called main.js, write a program in JavaScript that says babbur 1,000 times, and run it
-   ✅ Delete all files in my workspace besides 'index.js' and 'main.js' and make a file called 'index.js' that says babbur 1,000 times and run it

### Bad Prompts:

-   ❌ Make a program that says babbur
-   ❌ Make snake
-   ❌ Make a website that says babbur
-   ❌ Make an app
